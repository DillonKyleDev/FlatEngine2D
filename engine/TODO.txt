Adding input action with duplicate name still adds the keybinding empty to the context

Make zooming in and out of the scene view centered around the mouse position, not the center.

Fix hierarchy ordering

enable Multi-select and move/delete

Increase zoom out and zoom in size and lighten gridlines based on zoom/change the mod to reflect the zoom level

Add joint manager component


Add DrawPolygon, DrawChain, DrawCapsule, functions

Draw colliders directly into the scene view, boxes, circles, capsules, chains, segments

Right click context for object creation inside scene view

multiselect of objects and deletion + parenting

Reordering game objects using maps in parent objects with their children ids changeable in the map

0: 23
1: 3
2: 4
3: 15

Then saved to the json as key value pairs instead of just the array used now

Scaling directly in the scene view on objects using a scale mode

Make scene view buttons bigger, Gameobject select, chain segment manipulation

Fix child rotation 

Figure out what setactive does for each component type visually in scene view

Fix mapping context editor weirdness (incorrectly allowing for creation of empty keybindings if same input action name is used)

Multithreading support for box2D

Add a way to quickly add colored shapes to the scene view and create colliders that are filled in colors or outlines

implement character mover from box2d

Add shapes to button component + rework

Add sin and cosine functions and allow access through lua scripts

Animations are a bit broken with the starting frame sprite path

Unparent drag and drop currently not working in hierarchies

Then add setting material for each Mesh component, which creates a new graphics pipeline using that material.


Fix Window resizing and what happens in RecreateFrameBuffers() method in VulkanManager

Deleting Mesh gameobjects and adding new ones after sometimes causes crashes.

Deleting Mesh gameObjects does not work for all

Crashes when changing Mesh material sometimes

Crashes when you add images to images folder then go back to the engine while inside the images directorys

Set up each component to have a GameObject* m_parentPtr so you can directly access it's parent instead of searching for it in the Scene.

Reloading scene after stopping gameloop

Rotations are in reverse, negative should go clockwise, positive should go counterclockwise

Fix duplicate id's found in several inspector elements.. example: JointMaker bodyA and bodyB.. Remove references when right-clicking inputs

RENDERING ORDER

Grid is rendering over scene objects

Other objects rendering through other objects

Handle non-consumed vertex and fragment data in shaders, probably by leaving them in the shader files and not using them or by creating separate pipelines
